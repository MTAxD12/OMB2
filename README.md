# O Masinuta Bnegoasa 2

## Description
**O Masinuta Bnegoasa 2** is my first game created in Unity. It is a casual game with simple mechanics, based on a concept inspired by Brackeys' tutorials. This project was an opportunity to learn more about game development and how to use Unity.

The game consists of **7 levels** with increasing difficulty, making the final stages very challenging. It features **3 different endings**, providing varied outcomes based on player choices.

There are **two difficulty modes**:
- **Normal Mode** – Standard difficulty with checkpoints.
- **Hardcore Mode** – If you die, you must restart from the first level.
